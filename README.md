# Steam Punch

Steam Punch is a game in VERY early development for the [F256Jr/K](https://c256foenix.com/f256-jr/?v=796834e7a283) retro computer by [Foenix Retro Systems](https://c256foenix.com/?v=796834e7a283). The name kind of hints of the type of game, it's a Steam Punk Mecha fighting game.

Currently, there are no guarantees this will become a real game soon (or at all). 

But it's actively being worked on and all the source code and assets will be freely available in this repository.
